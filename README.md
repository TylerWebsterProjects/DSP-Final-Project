Final Project is on the subject of [Spectrum Representation](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/03spect/overview.html)

The graphical representation of signals via their frequency content is treated. In addition, we will synthesize more complicated sinusoidal waveforms composed of sums of sinusoidal signals, each with a different frequency.

The following lab exercises are completed

[P-4: AM and FM Sinusoidal Signals](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/03spect/labs/AMFMSignalsLab/AMFMSignalsLab.pdf)
- 4 Lab Exercise: Chirps and Beats
  - 4.1 Beat Notes
  - 4.2 More on Spectrograms
  - 4.3 Spectrogram of a Chirp

[P-7: FM Synthesis for Musical Instruments](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/03spect/labs/FMsynthLab/FMsynthLab.pdf)
- 4 FM Synthesis of Instrument Sounds
  - 4.1 Generating the Bell Envelopes
  - 4.2 Parameters for the Bell
  - 4.3 The Bell Sound
  - 4.4 Comments about the Bell

[S-7: Spectrograms of AM and FM Signals](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/03spect/labs/SpecgramsAMFM/SpecgramsAMFM.pdf)
