%% FM Synthesis for Musical Instruments - Bells and Clarinets: Lab P7 - Exercise 4

%% 4.1) Generating the Bell Envelopes
% See the file "bellenv.m" for implemenentation
% FIXME: Sierra, contribute what you'd like here

%% 4.2) Parameters for the Bell
% See the file "bell.m" for implementation
% FIXME: Sierra, contribute what you'd like here

%% 4.3) The Bell Sound
% FIXME: Intending to add more cases in the future for extra credit. For
% now, choose case 1 and case 5.
% Two of the six cases presented in the table of section 4.3 are analyzed.

%% 4.3a) - Listening to Sounds of the Bell
%% 4.3a) -> Case 1:
% This bell tone has a very deep and long droning sound, with what feels
% like slow beat tone/reverberation.

FM_Synth_4(1);

%% 4.3a) -> Case 5:
% This tone feels similar to case one in terms of depth and long droning
% sound, but has a characteristically different initial tone, sounding more
% like a bell you would hear ring in a church or city to tell time.

FM_Synth_4(5);

%% 4.3b) - Calculating Fundamental Frequencies of the Bell
%% 4.3b) -> Case 1:
% FIXME: need to figure out appropriate equation/analytical tactic for
% finding fundamental frequency

output = FM_Synth_4(1,true, true);

%% 4.3b) -> Case 5:

%% 4.4) Comments about the bell
